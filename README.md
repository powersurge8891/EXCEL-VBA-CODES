# EXCEL-VBA-CODES
This repo was born as a result of my automation project in MediaTrak Nigeria Limited. I was commissioned to write macros that would enable the automation of our reporting system and standardize the company's template. I started this project on 5th April, 2022 and delivered the work to management on 19th of the same month. Any future update to this code will be added to this repo. I got some assistance from  Harshad Shete, Daniel Silveira, Celia Alves and Paul E. Wilson at some point in this project. 

As time permits, more VBA projects will be added to this repo.
